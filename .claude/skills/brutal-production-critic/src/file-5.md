## VERDICT: The Math Doesn't Work Yet

### YOUR ASSUMPTIONS vs REALITY

| Your Assumption | Industry Reality | Gap |
|----------------|------------------|-----|
| 100 customers in Year 1 | Average B2B SaaS: 10-30 customers Y1 | 3-10x optimistic |
| $100/month pricing | Construction tech: $200-500/month | Underpriced |
| $50K dev cost | MVP for this complexity: $75-150K | Unrealistic |

### THE REAL NUMBERS

**Revenue RealityYear 1)**
- Conservative: 20 customers × $100 = $24,000 ARR
- Realistic: 40 customers × $100 = $48,000 ARR  
- Optimistic: 70 customers × $100 = $84,000 ARR

**Cost Reality**
- Development: $75,000 (your $50K is fantasy for construction domain complexity)
- Server/infrastructure: $3,000/year
- Support: $5,000/year (you = support)
- Sales/marketing: $15,000 (minimum to get any customers)
- **Total Year 1 Burn: ~$98,000**

**Year 1 P&L**
- Revenue: $48,000 (realistic)
- Expenses: $98,000
- **Net: -$50,000**

You need $50K+ more than you planned. Do you have it?

### B2B SALES CYCLE REALITY

**Construction Industry Specifics:**
- Sales cycle: 3-6 months (not weeks)
- Decision makers: Owners, PMs, sometimes field crews
- Tech adoption: Low. This industry resists change.
- Seasonality: Dead in winter. Build in Q1, sell in Q2.

**What This Means:**
- If you start selling in January, first revenue: May-June
- You'll burn cash for 5+ months before meaningful revenue
- Your runway needs to account for this

### METRICS YOU NEED TO TRACK

**Pre-Launch (Now)**
- [ ] 20 customer interviews (not surveys)
- [ ] 3 letters of intent or pre-payments
- [ ] Competitor feature matrix (Procore, Autodesk, etc.)

**Post-Launch (Month 1-3)**
- [ ] Leads generated per month
- [ ] Pipeline value ($)
- [ ] Sales cycle length
- [ ] Win rate (leads → customers)

**Traction (Month 3-6)**
- [ ] MRR growth rate (target: 15-20% MoM)
- [ ] Logo churn (<5% annually for B2B)
- [ ] NPS (>40)
- [ ] Net revenue retention (>100% = upsells > churn)

### MY HONEST ADVICE

**Don't build yet. Do this instead:**

1. **Validate with fake doors:** Landing page + 3 weeks of ads. Measure conversion.
2. **Pre-sell:** Get 5 companies to commit to $100/month before coding anything.
3. **Raise your price:** $100/month signals "cheap tool" to enterprises. $300/month signals "solution."
4. **Talk to 20 construction PMs:** Ask how they manage inventory NOW. What's the pain? Is it $100/month painful?

**If you can't get 3 pre-sales in 4 weeks, don't build.** You'd be saving yourself $50K+ and 6 months.

**Success probability with current plan: 25%**
**Success probability with validation first: 45%**
