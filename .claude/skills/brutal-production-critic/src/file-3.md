## VERDICT: Moderate Potential, High Execution Risk (40-50% success)

### WHAT'S WORKING
- **Pricing power:** $20/month is solid. Users see value.
- **Specific focus:** Marketing teams is a real, underserved vertical vs. horizontal PM tools
- **Revenue traction:** $2,400 MRR from 120 users = $20 ARPU. This is healthy for early stage.

 THE BRUTAL REALITY

**You're in the "Feature Not Product" Danger Zone**
- Asana, Monday, ClickUp can add content approval chains in 2 sprints
- Your differentiation is shallow and easily copied
- Marketers already use tools they know. Switching cost is high.

**Your Numbers Hide Dangerous Patterns**
- 120 active users after 3 months is modest
-urn rate? (You didn't say. My guess: 8-12%/month - typical for this stage)
- CAC? If >$50, you're bleeding
- What % of users are power users vs. one-and-done?

**Go-to-Market is Your Real Challenge**
- How do you acquire marketing teams at scale?
- Content marketing? (Every PM tool does this)
- Cold outreach? (Inboxes are flooded)
- Product-led growth? (What's your viral mechanism?)

### SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

**Pivot to "System of Record" for Marketing Ops**
- Don't be a PM tool. Be a marketing operations platform.
- Integrate with: HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack, Figma
- Become the single source of truth for campaign performance
- This is harder to copy and switching costs

**Immediate Metrics to Fix**
1. Activation rate: % of signups that create a workflow
2. Week 1 retention: This predicts long-term success
3. NPS: Anything below 40 means you're not solving a real problem
4. Expansion revenue: Are accounts upgrading? This is your growth lever

**Capital Efficiency Reality Check**
- At $2,400 MRR, you're not yet at "ramen profitability" for a team
- You have 6-12 months to prove you can grow this to $10-15K MRR
- If you're burning >$15K/month, you're on a clock

### SUCCESS SCENARIOS

**Conservative (60% likely):**
- Plateau at $5-8K MRR, become a nice lifestyle business
- Exit through acquihire or small acquisition

**Realistic (30% likely):**
- Reach $50K MRR in 18 months through focused niche domination
- Raise seed round to expand to adjacent verticals

**Optimistic (10% likely):**
- Become the default marketing ops platform
- Reach $1M ARR in 3 years
- Exit for $20-50M

**My honest advice:** You have something. But differentiate deeper or die by feature comparison. Focus on integration depth, not breadth. Build moats through data, not UI.

**Investability:** C (needs more growth or clearer differentiation)
**Time to clear signal:** 3 more months of current trajectory
