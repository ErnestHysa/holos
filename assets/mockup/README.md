## 🎨 Design Decisions to Make

When using these mockups, decide:

### 1. Wellness Score Display
- Circular gauge like Apple Health?
- Or large number like nutrition insights?
- Or combination of both?

### 2. Progress Bar Style
- Thin horizontal bars (like nutrition insights)?
- Or thick bars with labels (like health insights)?
- Color scheme: Green (good), Amber (warning), Red (poor)?

### 3. Card Layout
- White cards with shadows (like all these mockups)?
- Or colored cards (minimal approach)?
- Rounded corners: 12px, 16px, or 20px?

### 4. Typography Hierarchy
- How bold should headlines be?
- Should body text be readable at small sizes?
- What size for labels vs values?

### 5. Icon Style
- Outline icons (lightweight)?
- Filled icons (bolder)?
- Or emojis (like onboarding mockups)?

### 6. Notification Style
- Card-based notifications (like #12)?
- Or list-based?
- Should meal suggestions be visually distinct?

### 7. Onboarding Flow
- Goal selection cards (like #7) OR multi-step flow (like #16-18)?
- Or combination (goals first, then multi-step setup)?
